# MaterialPowerMenu
A demo of the power menu with Reveal and other animations

Some days ago, I saw a gif on Google+ demonstating a concept of Android Power menu in material design, it contained various Circular Reveal animations introduced in 
Lollipop and various other beautiful animations. I was able to replicate the concept using basic xml animations and Circular Reveal APIs. This repository is the demo of 
the original concept.

You can download the app from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naman14.powermenu)
